Summary
This web app is from the field of informatics and information technologies. It aims to facilitate the work of librarians and book’s finding by reader. Through the website, the employees can quickly and easily check if a book is in the library, if it is available, in how many copies and where it is located. The reader can find in which library wished book is located or choose from library’s fund. The website was created using ASP.NET CORE WEB APP. 
Full documentation is available in the current folder. This web app is used as a graduation project.

I provide a ink to Google Drive where can be found the detailed documentation of the project as well as link to the web app:
