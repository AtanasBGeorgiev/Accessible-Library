This web app is from the field of informatics and information technologies. It aims to facilitate the work of librarians and book’s finding by reader. Through the website, the employees can quickly and easily check whether a book is in the library, whether it is available, in how many copies and where it is located. The reader can find in which library wished book is located or choose from library’s fund. The website was created using ASP.NET CORE WEB APP.
